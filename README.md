# SuperMarioDemo-Unity-
A level from super mario 64 made with Unity<br/>
This project was given to us in a game development class at Concordia University<br/>
All the assets and the scene were provided to us, but assigning each gameobject and writing all the script to make the game logic function was made by me. UI art was also done by me.

# To run the code
-Create a Unity project and replace your Assets and project settings with the ones included in my Unityfiles.zip.<br/>

# How to play
-WASD to move<br/>
-Escape key for pause menu<br/>
-Left click to punch and talk to Boo.<br/>
-Mouse move for camera controls.<br/>
-Beat the game by racing boo to the top of the mountain

Tips:<br/>
-Coins make you faster and red coins even more fast.<br/>
-Sometimes Thwomps will one hit KO the player so be careful.<br/>
-There are 8 red coins in the map. Good luck finding them all.<br/>
